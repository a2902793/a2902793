### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Johnny Yeng

<br>
I'm an undergraduate student at Tamkang University, Taiwan. I like everything technology-wise and strive to be a "whole stack" person, learning about programming, electronics, firmware and hardware. I currently serve as IT in my lab and hold the record for being the youngest to have a seat in a lab (which are usually only for graduates) in my department.<br>Christopher Nolan films, Corona Extra, and Coffee are my three essentials of life. If you like to know more about me, take a look at my <a href="./CV.pdf">CV</a>.
