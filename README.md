I'm an undergraduate student at Tamkang University, Taiwan. I like everything technology-wise and strive to be a "whole stack" person, learning about programming, electronics, firmware and hardware. I currently serve as IT in my lab and hold the record for being the youngest to have a seat in a lab (which are usually only for graduates) in my department. My three essentials of life are:<ul><li>Christopher Nolan films</li><li>Corona Extra</li><li>Coffee</li></ul>If you like to know more about me, take a look at my <a href="./CV.pdf">CV</a>.<br><br>
